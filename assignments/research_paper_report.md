With a rise in smartphones with high-quality cameras, so has visitor tendencies to document their museum visits and share photos online. In particular, the paper focused on the use of smart phone and the different applications that are stored on them (in this case Instagram) in sharing museum experiences. In addition to the high resolution cameras, the paper also touches on how "the always-online nature of smartphones makes them a powerful technology for facilitating social interaction" (Weilenmann 2) Apart from this,  one of their interesting findings were the notions of visitors as online curators in that they create different narratives to what was perhaps initially observed inside of the original museum setting. 

The paper also highlighted the use of tagging not just as a way to organize photos and media for oneself but also as a way to create a conversation stream that people can interact with. On top of this, such an organization allows people to locate the stream with their topic of interest. This type of organization will allow the images being shared not to be limited to the context in which they were originally shared and as a result of a communal effort via comments and sharing be given extra context by the community engaging with the instagram image. 

One of the other interesting points raised by the paper was the new possibility to have museum visitors concrete museum create virtual exhibits. Because of the always online nature that I explained before, museums have a serious ability to create collaborative art on a much larger scale than providing arts and crafts booths where people create small pieces which are added to a wall. 

Another interesting observation made by  Weilenmann et al. was the underlying narrative conveyed when viewing the instagrams of a user as a stream. Images shared in succession can amount to telling a story that is much more profound than the message conveyed by the individual messages, a classical case of “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” I think that including a user profile that houses each person’s posts would be useful in maintaining this kind of storytelling ability of user post streams. 

One of the suggestions we could have adopted from this reading is the possibility to manipulate images before posting them. The reading mentioned the role of both editing software and filters on Instagram in allowing users to better convey the stories they want to tell and limiting their artistic freedom to just comments and captions may not have been the best idea for us since we do want to supply our users with enough artistic freedom to express their thoughts in a post they share. 

The tagging feature will also be very useful in not only allowing us to create a thematic collection of posts for gearing certain posts toward people’s interests, but also to enable people to search for a specific thread of posts that match a particular tag they may be looking to find.

Another suggestion that is put forward in the article is the usefulness of fluidity in choice of different social media platforms in conveying messages among one another. Different sites are well suited for sharing different types of media and taking advantage of the strengths of other media is important.
