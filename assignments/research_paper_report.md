With a rise in smartphones with high-quality cameras, so has visitor tendencies to document their museum visits and share photos online. In particular, the paper focused on the use of smart phone and the different applications that are stored on them (in this case Instagram) in sharing museum experiences. In addition to the high resolution cameras, the paper also touches on how "the always-online nature of smartphones makes them a powerful technology for facilitating social interaction" (Weilenmann 2) Apart from this,  one of their interesting findings were the notions of visitors as online curators in that they create different narratives to what was perhaps initially observed inside of the original museum setting. 

The paper also highlighted the use of tagging not just as a way to organize photos and media for oneself but also as a way to create a conversation stream that people can interact with. On top of this, such an organization allows people to locate the stream with their topic of interest. This type of organization will allow the images being shared not to be limited to the context in which they were originally shared and as a result of a communal effort via comments and sharing be given extra context by the community engaging with the instagram image. 

One of the other interesting points raised by the paper was the added possibility to have museum visitors co-create virtual museum exhibits. Because of the 'always online' nature of most social media users, there is great potential for collaboration and dialogue in creating collaborative art on a much larger scale than would perhaps traditionally be possible by simply having people come into arts and cragts booths within small sections of the museum space to create miniature pieces that then collectively make up the final whole. 

Another interesting observation made by  Weilenmann et al. was the underlying narrative conveyed when viewing the instagrams of a user as a stream. Images shared in succession can amount to telling a story that is much more profound than the message conveyed by the individual messages, a classical case of “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” I think that, with The Gallery in particular, including a user profile that houses each person’s posts would be useful in maintaining this kind of storytelling ability of user post streams. 

One of the suggestions we could have adopted from this reading is the possibility to manipulate images before posting them. The reading mentioned the role of both editing software and filters on Instagram in allowing users to better convey the stories they want to tell. In hindsight, limiting our users' artistic freedom to just comments and captions may not have been the best idea for us since we do want to supply our users with enough artistic freedom to express their thoughts in a post they share. Therefore, we may need to allow such functionality to either exist in The Gallery or give our users the option to edit the high quality photos from the digitized collection using a remote application and import it in when they want to share it. 

The tagging feature will also be very useful in not only allowing us to create a thematic collection of posts for gearing certain posts toward people’s interests, but also to enable people to search for a specific thread of posts that match a particular tag they may be looking to find.
