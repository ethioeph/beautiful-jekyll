As soon as we open the map we are given a bird’s eye view of the entire campus which would allow us to easily locate and zoom into the place we want to go. One of the Locations (in this case Admission Tour Locations”) is already selected at the welcome screen and users are able to now predict the effects on selecting any other one of the given check boxes.

In addition to this, there are clear signifiers to all major affordances of the site. There is a clearly visible searching signifier via the magnifying glass, printing signifier via the printer icon on the top right, and ability to hide and show the leftmost navigation pane via the hamburger icon on the top left.  


The site is just as good when we are interacting with it as well. For instance, when clicking on the search icon, it pulls in the search query form for the user to insert his/her desired location. The use of signifier here to let users know that the search feature is available while making use of minimal space that doesn’t clutter the navigation pane is well done.

The navigation pane on the left is also very intuitive in that it gives the illusion of having a drop down menu that can be expanded for further exploration. It also affords another way to search the site, perhaps if we are unsure how to spell the name of a specific building.

One minor edit that could be added to this site is the possibility to change the orientation of the map depending on where one needs to go. Moving backwards on a map while actually walking forward in a mirror image world is not always easy, but just as Norman illustrated by mentioning boats and wheelchairs, there is definitely some intuition to navigating in such an environment.
