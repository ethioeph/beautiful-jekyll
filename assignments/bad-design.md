When we follow the link to the Williams college housing portal we are welcomed by the following screen. The link to the actual information that is requried from this site has the smallest font on the page and is barely visible. Instead there is a huge color uncoordinated text in green that points us back to the top of the page to find the link.

When we follow the link we are met with the login page below. One can easily imagine propagating this page to the initial welcome page for ease of access.

After logging in, in the building roster section, we are only able to move through buildings by hovering over the slider. There are no searching features or abilities to slide faster if we choose to do so. As can be seen, while having access to the housing portal online has made life easier, there are still quite a few improvements that need to be made.
