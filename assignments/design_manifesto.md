# Introduction

Prior to the start of my fall semester here at Williams College, my definition of design and whether or not something had good or bad design merely reflected the aesthetic appeal of the thing in question. On my first day in my Human Computer Interaction class we were presented with two door handles and asked to figure out which one of two doors had a good design and which one had a bad design. It was at this moment that I had to either start broadening my definition of design or try to somehow find a way to find a door of all things aesthetically pleasing. The latter was not looking too likely and so began a deep dive into the multifaceted world of design, more specifically User-Centered Design.

Over the course of the semester, two friends (Spencer, Javier) and I have been working towards creating a mobile application called The Gallery[] while adhering to the good design practices that we were picking up in our readings along the way. While we ultimately found that there is no best design to rule them all, there are some good tips that helped us refine our designs as we continued to iteratively improve The Gallery. 

Without further ado, let's get into the design principles.

# Design Principles

*You & #8773 User*

As much as we would like our users to be able to use products that have been designed to functionality and effectiveness at enabling certain tasks as good measures of usability. It is, therefore, very important that you figure out who your users are and what they want early on before spending too much time designing a product that only serves the needs you and your team perceive to exist. 

So, how do you find out what your users need? In our case, this took the form of three back to back contextual inquiries. Having confirmed people’s eagerness to share their thoughts about Art, we went ahead with our initial conception of what functionalities The Gallery will serve: a medium for people to both share their thoughts about Art and discover new Art in the process. 

One other moment that highlighted how much we, as Designers, are unlike our users was our first usability test with a fellow Williams College student. Our expectation going in was that of people who were really proud of their presumably well designed handiwork. However, even though our user was able to perform the task, his conceptual model of how our app worked was different from what we had imagined it to be, and we had to go back to the drawing board to make some changes to accommodate his verbalized thought patterns.

*Design with Everyone in mind*

You should design to make things usable to as many people as possible and by doing so you are also generally improving the usability experience for the rest of the population as suggested by this article on creating accessible websites. In our website we have a clear navigation at the top panel that is easily adaptable for screen readers and a title of our website along with a brief description to let people figure out the layout and content of the website. 

In addition to this, our digital mockup adhered to the simplistic view of most social media apps on the market so as to both reduce the learning curve of adapting to our app but also to reap the unexplained apparent benefits for the way the design was iteratively improved over a couple of years by big research companies like facebook and instagram. 

*Clearly signify all affordances*

Is it Afforded or not? The answer to this question is ideally not ambiguous when you are looking at your design. Clearly visible affordances with sound signifiers make interaction with your product much easier and it is very easy to miss putting in the right signifiers for people to figure this out. ([003 affordSigConstraints chapter 4, what page was this?] For instance, changing the shade of buttons on the screen when they are pressable was a subtle flaw in our prototype that we had to learn when people were trying to press buttons at times in our task flow that we had not anticipated, for instance pressing  upload from the bottom navigation in the middle of an uploading sequence. Therefore we covered up the buttons that were unavailable to our users using small bits of white paper when performing our subsequent usability tests using our paper prototypes.

Similarly, one can also mistakenly think that certain functionality is present because of the presence of unexpected unintended signifiers. In our case, this resurfaced in the form of one our users thinking that they could search for pieces of Art in their personal Gallery once they had pressed the upload button that we had placed in the bottom navigation. However, the search feature was not present where our user had conceptually expected it to be so we ended up having to merge the two functionalities to adhere to simplicity without loss of functionality.

*Uphold Personal Code of Ethics*

Upholding a high ethical standard has never been a more crucial issue that it is in the present time. In the era of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, the effects of biases introduced as a result of unethical behaviour on the part of the designer or developer will end up having exponential effects due to the massive scale of the reach of most of the applications that involve such technology. One can point to the ethical fallibility of not having a clear code of ethics in situations such as those seen in this article.[link to machine learning bias article.] 

Most of my personal ethical guidelines have crossovers with the the signal code(link to the pdf) . Even though I was introduced to it after the design process, I believe that the rights listed within it are at their core equivalent to any basic universally accepted human rights. 

- “Right to privacy and security”: During our usability testing as well as contextual inquiries, we made sure that the identity of our participants remained private. This is crucial because no one can predict how such data can be used against the participants and it is generally a classic better safe than sorry situation. 

- “Right to rectification and redress”: During our initial prototype for The Gallery our users were unable to delete posts that they had made. In addition to affording this to our users we also created a 

- “Right to protection”: Even though we do not particularly anticipate anything violent to come out of The Galler, we were sure that there might be a conflict of interest in having all of one’s posts be public so we included the possibility for users to restrict the visibility of their posts to either selected friends or groups.
